# Feature Selection With DNN Learning Hub ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the Feature Selection Learning Hub! This platform is dedicated to providing comprehensive resources and tutorials on feature selection techniques, based on the research articles from Dr. Ofir Lindenbaum's [research lab](https://www.eng.biu.ac.il/lindeno/). Whether you're new to feature selection or looking to deepen your understanding, this hub is designed to support your learning journey.

## :bulb: Introduction

Feature selection is a critical aspect of machine learning and data analysis, enabling the identification of relevant features that contribute most to model performance. The research articles produced by Dr. Ofir Lindenbaum's lab offer innovative approaches and methodologies for feature selection, spanning both supervised and unsupervised learning domains. This learning hub serves as a central repository for exploring and implementing these techniques, as well as examining known approaches and algorithms, enriching the understanding of the feature selection field.

## :hammer: Usage

Install the package from pypi:
`pip install featselectlib`

Here is a brief example demonstrating how to use the featselectlib package for feature selection:

```python
import featselectlib
import torch
from omegaconf import OmegaConf

# Define Model Using STG

feature_selection = True
model = featselectlib.STG(task_type='classification',input_dim=X_train.shape[1], output_dim=2, hidden_dims=[60, 20], activation='tanh',
    optimizer='SGD', learning_rate=0.1, batch_size=X_train.shape[0], feature_selection=feature_selection, sigma=0.5, lam=0.5, random_state=1, device='cpu') 

# Run feature selection
   
mu_prob,gates_prob=model.fit(X_train, y_train, nr_epochs=5000, valid_X=X_valid, valid_y=y_valid, print_interval=1000)

# define you cfg parameters for lscae/cae/ls/gl models
cfg = OmegaConf.create({"input_dim": 100})

# define you dataset (Torch based)

dataset = torch.utils.data.Dataset(...)
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=cfg.batch_size, shuffle=True, drop_last=True)
lscae_model, lscae_cfg = setup_model(X.shape[1], 'lscae')
lscae.Lscae(kwargs=cfg).select_features(dataloader)
```
